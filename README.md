# SRAM
Design of an 64x12 SRAM Array with peripherals in 65nm technology
The 6T SRAM consists of 6 transistors that are ratioed hence the read and write operations are done properly, in this design a size ratio of 3-2-1 for PDN-Access-PUN respectively was used after careful considerations. The SRAM array consists of 64 rows each row consists of 12 bits hence each row consists of 12 6T SRAM cells with a total size of the array of 768 cells. Address decode (known as row decoder) was used to access the worldline for certain word (row) for a 64 words the address decoder is conventionally a 6 to 64 decoder but in this design a 16 to 64 address decoder was implemented which less power efficiency and more number of pins on chip, similarly for the column decoder since 12 columns wonâ€™t give an integer number of address bits, in this design a 4 to 16 decoder was used with setting 4 of the 16 outputs to ground, hence it will reduce the number of pins on the chip from 12 to 4. Precharge circuit for the 12 bit lines and 12 bit line bars was implemented to charge the design to VDD before the read operation to avoid logic flipping. A Sense amplifier and write drivers  for the 12 bit lines and  12 bit line bars were implemented, where the bit lines from the column decoder are connected to both write drivers and sense amplifiers and depending on the address input signal, the column selection circuit selects the required columns on which read or write operations are performed,  a read operation is performed by sense amplifiers to speed up the read operation by amplifying the voltage difference between Bl and BL_B, and a write operation is performed by the write drivers.
